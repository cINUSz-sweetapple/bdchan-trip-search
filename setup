## setup

1. clone this repository or download the script.

   **clone url (if needed):**
   
# git clone https://github.com/cINUSz/bdchan-trip-searcher.git


2. edit `bdchan.py` to customize:
- `prefix` (base input for generating tripcodes)
- `suffix_length` (length of the brute-force portion)
- `target_words` (list of words to match tripcodes against)

---

## usage

once you've set your preferences, run the script with:
# python3 bdchan.py


the script will start generating tripcodes and checking them against the target words. matching results will be saved to `matches.txt` and displayed in the terminal in real-time.

## example match output

here’s what you can expect in the terminal when a match is found:
## admiNQ ≈ admin (83%) ← abc3dkaozowjskqh
